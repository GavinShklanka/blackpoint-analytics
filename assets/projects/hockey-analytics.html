    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This system establishes a performance measurement model combining KPI frameworks, SQL-based ETL processes, 
      and exploratory analytical methods. The goal is to provide coaches with decision-ready insights that highlight 
      player contributions, team trends, and tactical opportunities.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Components</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>KPI Framework:</strong> Offensive, defensive, transition, and possession-based metrics aligned to coaching priorities.</li>
      <li><strong>SQL Pipeline:</strong> Structured ETL workflow processing InStat reports and preparing data for reporting and model use.</li>
      <li><strong>Player Micro-Metrics:</strong> Faceoff efficiency, puck-battle results, pass networks, and event-level contributions.</li>
      <li><strong>Team Success Index:</strong> Integrated measure combining expected contribution, shift value, and positional impact.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
      The system supports pre-game preparation, post-game reviews, player development tracking, and data-driven strategic adjustments.
